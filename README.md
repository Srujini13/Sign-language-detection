## Realtime Sign Language Detection Using LSTM
A deep learning-based project aimed at recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures in real time using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Capturing live video feeds, the system detects gestures instantly, providing an assistive technology for individuals with hearing impairments. Built with Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NumPy, the model achieves high recognition accuracy and allows easy customization of new gestures, bridging communication gaps effectively.
